List of concerns + changes made:
"About the Development Team" was irrelevant heading as we only had data sources and a small footnote at the bottom 
        --> Changed heading to "Dataset Source" and added small description
Colon needed for the main title for appropriate punctuation 
        --> added
Graph headers contained redundant "The Budget Hawk's" at the beginning 
        --> removed
Clicking the section links brought the user to the graph instead of the section header 
        --> coding difficulties ensued and was unable to correct
It was not specified in the first graph that rapes, robberies, homicides and aggravated assaults were types of violent crimes and were breakdowns of the "violent crimes" section 
        --> clarification made

This concludes the list of concerns and changes made during the website editing session on 4/27/2021
