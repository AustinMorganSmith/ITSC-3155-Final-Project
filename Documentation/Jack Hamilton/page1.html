            The Budget Hawk seeks to minimize budgetary expenditures in various cities and states by comparing police
            department spending against crime rates reported by the FBI. Thus, allowing for policy makers in those
            cities and states to minimize and properly prioritize their budgets if crime rates have been reliably
            declining.

            Recently the media has been plagued with reactions and analyses of police actions against suspects and other
            civilians. The outrage by the public called for the defunding of police departments as they were deemed
            unnecessary or excessive in how they protected communities. The ways in which police have handled past cases
            varies, but it heavily relies not only on the personnel they employ, but also the budget given to them.
            Higher budgets and costs are mainly for those departments who are in high crime-ridden areas where there is
            a huge need for resources for police officers to use to protect the general public.

        <p>
            This raises the question of how much is actually necessary for police departments to be able to effectively
            protect the people and enforce laws? It’s given that when there is a lot of crime, a lot of money is needed
            to sort out and solve these problems; however, what happens when crime rates go back down? How can we tell
            how the budget should be adjusted when the crime rates seem to dwindle? There is a need for regulation and
            efficiency in the budgets provided to police departments, so the departments can protect the community
            without putting a strain on the rest of the government budgets needed for regulation of the community.
